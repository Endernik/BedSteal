# BedSteal
Now OpenSource... BedSteal is addon for BedWars1058 (custom minigame)

BedSteal is a NEW INNOVATIVE MODE that is a combination of BedWars and Lifesteal. With the introduction of many innovative features, we managed to make the game even more dynamic. One of the main changes is the bed upgrade system. After destroying an opponent's respawn point, you get an item, and then by right-clicking it on your bed, you can upgrade your bed to the next level, which adds an ADDITIONAL HEART and upgrades the BED'S RIVER, which is the closest housing that the player cannot rebuild himself after destroying it. Another important change is the introduction of a NEW MEANS OF PAYMENT in the store, namely redstone, which we can get by destroying a bed or by killing SPECIAL MOBS in the middle of map (near emerald generators). With the obtained redstone, we can buy ROTATION ITEMS in the store, such as the Poisoned Sword. In the future, we plan to introduce more novelties, which we will inform you about as soon as possible.
